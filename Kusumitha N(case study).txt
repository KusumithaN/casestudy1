Est Strategy Steps – IDTS (class)
• Assess Testability – Each factor on a scale of 1 to 5;
– Operability - 4
– Controllability – 5 (since automation / performance testing will be applicable)
– Observability – 5 (since lot of end user testing is involved)
– Simplicity - 5 (since lot of end user testing is involved)
– Understandability - 4
– Suitability - 3
– Stability - 2
• 1 – Low; 5 – High; All low factors to be -  marked as it will affect test plan adversely
• Assess Test factors that Must  be considered for testing the software
– Authorization
– File Integrity
– Continuity of Processing
– Access Control
– Reliability
– Performance
• Identify lifecycle stages when V & V strategy should be applied
– Authorization – Integration Testing
– Correctness-Integration Testing
        Contuinity of Processing-Post UAT
        Access Control- System Testing
        Reliability-Production
        Performance-System Testing
        Integrity-System Testing
• Assess drivers that would influence the testing
– Authorization – Integration Testing – Quality Control
– File Integrity – System Testing - Training
– Audit Trail – UAT – Planning - Use of Process
– Continuity of Processing – Post UAT (production) – Management Support
– Access Control – System Testing – Training
– Reliability – Post UAT (production) – Efficiency
– Performance – System Testing – Tools
• Determine for life cycle/factor combinations (Methodology/Approach/Focus/Method)
– Authorization – Integration Testing (Verification/Black box/Functional/Dynamic)
– File Integrity – System Testing  (Verification/Whitebox/Structural/Dynamic)
– Audit Trail – UAT  (Validation/Blackbox/Functional/Dynamic)
– Continuity of Processing – Post UAT (production)    (Validation/Blackbox/Functional/Dynamic)
– Access Control – System Testing   (Verification/Blackbox/Functional/Dynamic)
– Reliability – Post UAT (production)   (Validation/Blackbox/Functional/Dynamic)
– Performance – System Testing   (Verification/Blackbox/Functional/Dynamic)


Test Plan – IDTS
1. Test items – IDTS Application Name
2. Software risk issues – Security of the application, Performance, Covering all OS/Browser combinations, Live feed testing
3. Features to be tested -Admin functions, Manager and member functions, Customer functions
4. Features not to be tested –Newer version of the system (scope is not clear)
5. Approach – Combination of Black box and White box
6. Item pass/fail criteria – Will be detailed in test cases. Application will be considered passed if there are less than 5 minor bugs, maximum of 1 major bug and no show stoppers
7. Suspension & Resumption criteria – Showstoppers in the application / Non availability of resources (ex : OS/browser combinations)
8. Test deliverables – Source code, Test Reports for Integration and System testing, Test cases for UAT, Reviewed Manuals, Defect Reports and Defect Metrics
9. Staffing & training needs – Training on domain and performance testing tool
10. Responsibilities – Project Manager, Test Lead, Test Engineers , Tool specialists and Customer/End Users
11. Schedule: Time to complete the work
